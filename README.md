# slick-util

Shimmed archive of [slick-util](https://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util/) that uses Gradle to build.

Removed features include the audio handling part and some misc utilities (more specifically `org.newdawn.slick.util.Log` as there's Log4J, SLF4J and such).

The [license](LICENSE) follows the original Slick2D distribution.
